   <!-- 2018-08-08 ebb: BEGIN with mitfordPre-Editable.odd Canonicalize it to mitfordEditable.odd before beginning to edit. The full ODD file is mitfordODD.odd.
      To make/edit/update the complete ODD: 
      * Open mitfordPre-Editable.odd and run canonicalize in oXygen to pull in the latest rules on the <occupation> element encoding from the SI GitHub repo. Output as mitfordEditable.odd.
      * Make any necessary edits to the document model (element modules from the TEI, general constraints, anything except Site Index updates) in the mitfordEditable.odd file.
      * If updating the ODD because of new site index updates, 
            1) be sure the new SI is posted at http://digitalmitford.org/si.xml. 
            2) Generate elementSpecs for new named entity markup (persons, places, titles, etc) with attribute values for @ref and @corresp 
      by running si-to-ODD.xsl over the current si.xml stored at http://digitalmitford.org/si.xml. Save the output file as MRMProsopRef.odd 
     * Finally generate the full ODD file by running mitfordODD-Combiner.xsl on mitfordEditable.odd, which pulls in site index data stored in MRMProsopRef.odd. 
     Save the output as mitfordODD.odd
     * "Run the wrench" in oXygen to generate the new Relax-NG XML-syntax project schema and HTML documentation for the project.
      2018-09-25 ebb: The canonical version of the Mitford ODD is stored in the DM_Documentation GitHub repo. Project schema lines should point to the ODD-generated Relax NG schema at https://digitalmitford.github.io/DM_documentation/MitfordODD/out/mitfordODD.rng

            <p>This ODD customizes the TEI P5 for use in edition files, including drama, letters, poetry, plays. It indicates the modules and customizations of TEI encoding for manuscript transcription, and versioning and prosopography references for all files in the project except for the prosopography index file known as our <q>Site Index</q>, which holds a narrower range of elements. The elements of the site index are available here in the <q>back lists</q> of our files for proposing new entries to be added, but according to this ODD, only a narrow range of person, place, and document referencing are permitted in edition files in order to enforce consistent prosopography markup across all files. </p>

                           <gloss>The Broken Fiddle William Allan circa 1821 Benjamin Robert Haydon described this painting to Mitford in a letter from Edinburgh in November 1821. Haydon wrote: I find Sir William Allan only in the town, he is painting a very clever picture of The Broken Fiddle. A wooden-legged sailor has broken his fiddle on the head of a young scamp for some mischievous trick; an old woman, his granddam, is shaking her fist at the sailor, who is enjoying the pain of the crying boy. . . . It promises to be a very clever thing indeed. The background in colour and effect is the best thing he has done., as excerpted in Benjamin Robert Haydon: Correspondence and Table-Talk, Vol. 2, p. 74 . The painting was frequently mentioned by 1820s periodical writers as one of Allan’s best. In 1822, Blackwood’s called it a piece of quite a different cast from anything he had formerly attempted. It is a highly humorous composition, and the glow of colouring is such as perhaps Wilkie himself never surpassed. Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine, 11 (1822): p. 439 .</gloss>

                           <gloss>The Broken Fiddle William Allan circa 1821 Benjamin Robert Haydon described this painting to Mitford in a letter from Edinburgh in November 1821. Haydon wrote: I find Sir William Allan only in the town, he is painting a very clever picture of The Broken Fiddle. A wooden-legged sailor has broken his fiddle on the head of a young scamp for some mischievous trick; an old woman, his granddam, is shaking her fist at the sailor, who is enjoying the pain of the crying boy. . . . It promises to be a very clever thing indeed. The background in colour and effect is the best thing he has done., as excerpted in Benjamin Robert Haydon: Correspondence and Table-Talk, Vol. 2, p. 74 . The painting was frequently mentioned by 1820s periodical writers as one of Allan’s best. In 1822, Blackwood’s called it a piece of quite a different cast from anything he had formerly attempted. It is a highly humorous composition, and the glow of colouring is such as perhaps Wilkie himself never surpassed. Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine, 11 (1822): p. 439 .</gloss>
