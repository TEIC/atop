            <p>This ODD customizes the TEI P5 for use in edition files, including drama, letters, poetry, plays. It indicates the modules and customizations of TEI encoding for manuscript transcription, and versioning and prosopography references for all files in the project except for the prosopography index file known as our <q>Site Index</q>, which holds a narrower range of elements. The elements of the site index are available here in the <q>back lists</q> of our files for proposing new entries to be added, but according to this ODD, only a narrow range of person, place, and document referencing are permitted in edition files in order to enforce consistent prosopography markup across all files. </p>

The letter specifically identifies Edmund Kean, Charles Young, and William Macready. Such demands include insisting on a limited run of performances and rewrites from the authors of plays to suit the actors’ tastes.

                              <gloss>The Broken Fiddle William Allan circa 1821 Benjamin Robert Haydon described this painting to Mitford in a letter from Edinburgh in November 1821. Haydon wrote: I find Sir William Allan only in the town, he is painting a very clever picture of The Broken Fiddle. A wooden-legged sailor has broken his fiddle on the head of a young scamp for some mischievous trick; an old woman, his granddam, is shaking her fist at the sailor, who is enjoying the pain of the crying boy. . . . It promises to be a very clever thing indeed. The background in colour and effect is the best thing he has done., as excerpted in Benjamin Robert Haydon: Correspondence and Table-Talk, Vol. 2, p. 74 . The painting was frequently mentioned by 1820s periodical writers as one of Allan’s best. In 1822, Blackwood’s called it a piece of quite a different cast from anything he had formerly attempted. It is a highly humorous composition, and the glow of colouring is such as perhaps Wilkie himself never surpassed Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine, 11 (1822): p. 439 .</gloss>

                              <gloss>The Broken Fiddle William Allan circa 1821 Benjamin Robert Haydon described this painting to Mitford in a letter from Edinburgh in November 1821. Haydon wrote: I find Sir William Allan only in the town, he is painting a very clever picture of The Broken Fiddle. A wooden-legged sailor has broken his fiddle on the head of a young scamp for some mischievous trick; an old woman, his granddam, is shaking her fist at the sailor, who is enjoying the pain of the crying boy. . . . It promises to be a very clever thing indeed. The background in colour and effect is the best thing he has done., as excerpted in Benjamin Robert Haydon: Correspondence and Table-Talk, Vol. 2, p. 74 . The painting was frequently mentioned by 1820s periodical writers as one of Allan’s best. In 1822, Blackwood’s called it a piece of quite a different cast from anything he had formerly attempted. It is a highly humorous composition, and the glow of colouring is such as perhaps Wilkie himself never surpassed Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine, 11 (1822): p. 439 .</gloss>
