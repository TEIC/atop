# README

This directory contains ODD files taken from different sources: TEIWiki, request on TEI-L, and GitHub queries.

If the TEIheader did not include information concerning the publication of the ODD (or if the contained information was insuficient to quickly access the project) 
a `<ptr/>` element to the repository/project was added to `<sourceDesc>` (together with a `<change>` element to record this addition).

See below some notes concerning the gathering process of these ODD files.
