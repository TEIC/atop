____________Suggestions from reviewers_______________

We thank the reviewers for their helpful responses. Here we list their concerns, and explain how we've addressed each one (IN CAPS):

 - Fix typos like "constraintiung" and "identifers"
DONE
 
 - Fix doubled words
DONE
 
 - Stress more clearly, early on, why the paper and the ATOP project is important.
INTRODUCTORY SECTIONS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED SLIGHTLY, BUT WE THINK THAT ANYONE LIKELY TO BE READING THIS PAPER WILL 
ALREADY UNDERSTAND WHAT ODD PROCESSING IS ABOUT AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. WHETHER THE PAPER ITSELF IS IMPORTANT
IS IN THE EYES OF THE READER, SURELY.
 
 - Rewrite section 1 DISCLOSURE to be more formal and detailed, naming the authors.
DONE
 
 - Add a new TERMINOLOGY section which pre-introduces and glosses key terms, including:
    TEI tagset (as Paragraph 3 does now) for the purposes of distinguishing Section 22 from the rest of TEI; ODD; ODD customization (or TEI ODD customization files); "TEI Stylesheets" (proper noun); roma; Roma (and difference from roma); XSPEC, XSpec Suite; PLODD; FLOSS.
DONE
    
 - Rewrite the section on TEI ODD processing to provide what it promises to ("a review of what TEI ODD is and an overview of how it is currently processed"), rather than a laundry list.
SOME MODIFICATIONS TO THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN MADE, BUT WE THINK THAT IF YOU'RE READING A PAPER ON ODD PROCESSING, YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHAT ODD IS. IF NOT, THE TEI GUIDELINES PROVIDE SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION.
 
 - Consider dropping the section on the history of the Stylesheets. If the terminology gloss of TEI Stylesheets is clear enough (without being too long), this section should not be needed.
WE DISAGREE HERE; THE HISTORY OF THE STYLESHEETS (RAPID AD-HOC DEVELOPMENT ALONGSIDE THE ODD SPECIFICATION) IS PART OF THE REASON THAT THEY ARE PROBLEMATIC NOW.
 
 - Consider combining the sections on Work Processes and Plans and Progress with a section ATOP, organized into Why, What, and How. (The why section might just point at the previous section -- we need ATOP because the current stylesheets are flawed and unmaintainable.) Maybe ATOP: Plans (including deliverables, workflow and testing) and ATOP: Progress? Consider adding sections on Deliverables, Workflow, Consistency and Testing, and Component Testing.
WE HAVE REORGANIZED THOSE SECTIONS, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO USE WHY, WHAT, AND HOW.
 
 - Consider saving space by losing the Emerson quote. 
DONE
 
 - Consider titling the last section "Issues with the current ODD" and enumerating some of these in more detail. 
DONE; WE HAVE BROUGHT IN SOME ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC ISSUES FROM OUR PADERBORN PAPER.
 
 - Consider explaining why XSLT 1.0 is not your SW of choice. 
WE THINK THIS IS POINTLESS. THE CURRENT STYLESHEETS ALREADY USE XSLT 2.0 FEATURES, AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY ANY DEVELOPER WITH THE OPTION TO USE XSLT 3 WOULD PREFER 1.0.
